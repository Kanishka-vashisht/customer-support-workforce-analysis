Customer Support Workforce Analysis
Project Overview

Customer support teams generate large amounts of operational data, but this data is often underutilized in day-to-day decision making.
This project analyzes workforce activity data to understand how employee working hours, efficiency, break patterns, and engagement relate to each other.

The goal of the analysis is to identify productivity gaps, workload imbalance, and improvement opportunities that can support better workforce planning and performance management.

Dataset

The dataset represents employee-level activity data from a customer support environment.
It includes information on working hours, productive time, different break categories, efficiency metrics, and engagement levels.

Main data areas:

Total working hours and effective working time

Break categories (lunch, normal breaks, meetings, training, unwanted breaks, others)

Calculated efficiency ratios

Engagement classification for employees

The data is structured across multiple sheets to support detailed analysis and dashboard creation.

Business Questions Addressed

Does higher working time always result in higher efficiency?

Which employees show signs of workload imbalance?

How effectively is break time being utilized?

Which break categories contribute most to non-productive time?

Who are the most efficient employees despite working fewer hours?

How is employee engagement distributed across the workforce?

Analysis Process

Data Cleaning

Standardized time formats

Removed blank and unnecessary entries

Cleaned and aligned employee naming conventions

Data Preparation

Segregated productive and non-productive time

Created efficiency ratios using working and effective hours

Grouped employees based on engagement levels

Analysis & Visualization

Used pivot tables to aggregate key metrics

Compared working hours with efficiency

Analyzed break distribution across employees

Built an Excel dashboard for clear visualization and interpretation

Key Insights

High working hours do not always correspond to high efficiency, indicating possible workload or process inefficiencies.

Several employees achieve strong efficiency with relatively fewer hours, suggesting more effective work practices.

Non-core and unwanted breaks contribute significantly to productivity loss.

Engagement levels vary across employees, highlighting the need for targeted management actions rather than uniform policies.

Conclusion

This analysis demonstrates how operational workforce data can be used to move beyond basic tracking and support data-driven decisions.
By combining working hours, efficiency metrics, and break analysis, the project highlights opportunities to improve productivity, balance workloads, and address engagement issues.
