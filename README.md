# Customer Support Workforce Analysis

## Project Overview
Customer support teams generate large volumes of operational data, but this data is often underutilized in day-to-day decision-making.  
This project analyzes workforce activity data to understand how employee **working hours**, **break patterns**, and **efficiency** relate to overall engagement and productivity.

The objective is to transform raw Excel data into clear insights that help managers identify **workload imbalance**, **efficiency gaps**, and **improvement opportunities** within a customer support team.

## Dataset
The dataset contains employee-level workforce information from a customer support environment, including:

- Total working hours  
- Productive (effective) working time  
- Break categories (lunch, normal breaks, meetings, training, unwanted breaks, etc.)  
- Calculated efficiency metrics  
- Engagement classification  

The data is organized across multiple Excel sheets to separate raw inputs, calculated metrics, pivot tables, and dashboard visuals.

## Business Questions Addressed
This analysis was guided by the following business questions:

- Does higher working time always result in higher efficiency?
- Which employees show signs of workload imbalance?
- How effectively is break time being utilized?
- Are there employees who perform efficiently with fewer working hours?
- How is engagement distributed across the workforce?
- What actions can improve productivity while reducing burnout risk?

## Analysis Process
The project follows a structured analytical workflow:

### 1. Data Preparation
- Standardized time formats across all sheets  
- Removed blank and unnecessary rows  
- Cleaned and aligned employee naming conventions  

### 2. Metric Creation
- Calculated productive time and efficiency ratios  
- Separated productive and non-productive activities  
- Categorized engagement levels using defined performance thresholds  

### 3. Exploratory Analysis
- Used pivot tables to compare working hours, efficiency, and break utilization  
- Identified performance patterns and operational inefficiencies  

### 4. Visualization
- Built an interactive Excel dashboard for easy interpretation by non-technical stakeholders

## Key Insights
- Higher working hours do not consistently translate into higher efficiency, indicating possible workload or process issues.
- Some employees maintain high efficiency with relatively fewer working hours, suggesting better work practices.
- Non-core and unwanted breaks contribute significantly to overall productivity loss.
- Engagement levels vary across employees, highlighting the need for targeted performance management.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates how **Excel-based analysis** can deliver meaningful operational insights when guided by a clear business objective.  
By linking working hours, efficiency, and engagement, the analysis identifies areas where productivity can be improved **without increasing employee workload**.

Overall, the project reflects a **practical, entry-level data analyst approach** to workforce analytics and emphasizes the importance of translating data into **actionable business decisions**.
